# Utility Binaries

This directory contains standalone utility scripts and tools for development, debugging, and tuning.

## List of Binaries

### 1. Helpmate Solver (`helpmate_solver.rs`)
A high-performance solver for Helpmate problems in Infinite Chess. It uses parallel search and specialized optimizations to solve problems significantly faster than general-purpose engines.

**Usage:**
```bash
cargo run --release --bin helpmate_solver --features parallel_solver -- --icn "<ICN>" --mate-in <PLIES> --mated-side <COLOR>
```

### 2. Evaluation Debugger (`eval_icn.rs`)
Debug tool to run the static evaluation function on a specific position and print a detailed trace of all scoring terms (material, king safety, etc.).

**Usage:**
```bash
cargo run --bin eval_icn "<ICN_STRING>"
```

### 3. SPSA Tuner (`spsa_tuner.rs`)
A version of the SPSA tuning system that uses perft results to tune the engine parameters.

**Usage:**
```bash
cargo run --release --bin spsa_tuner
```

### 4. Parameter Applicator (`apply_params.rs`)
A helper script that reads tuned parameters from `spsa_best_params.json` (generated by the tuner) and automatically updates the corresponding constants in `src/search/params.rs`.

**Usage:**
```bash
cargo run --bin apply_params
```

### 5. Magic Bitboard Generator (`generate_magics.rs`)
Pre-computes magic number constants for sliding piece attack generation. This is only needed when changing the board representation or move generation logic. Currently unused.

**Usage:**
```bash
cargo run --release --bin generate_magics
```
